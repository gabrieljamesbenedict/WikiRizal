      "text": "José Rizal’s first novel, Noli Me Tángere, was published in Berlin in 1887. It courageously exposed the injustices committed by the Spanish friars and colonial government in the Philippines. The story follows Crisóstomo Ibarra, a young man who returns from Europe and discovers the widespread corruption and abuse affecting his fellow Filipinos. The novel criticizes clerical power, promotes national consciousness, and lays the groundwork for reform. Its major themes include colonial oppression, social injustice, education, and national identity. It became a key tool in awakening Filipino nationalism and inspired future revolutionaries."
