      "text": "“The Indolence of the Filipinos”\n\nThis essay was also published in La Solidaridad and deals with the commonly heard colonial claim that Filipinos are lazy. Rizal frankly repudiates this label and argues that so-called indolence was documentary existe by socio-economic exploitation, workers are provided limited education and were under political trammel for this empire. Rizal elaborates on how Spain curtailed native industries and firms stopped individual initiative. Rizal provoked out how systemic problems caused the economic malaise and this is not a 'cultured' problem. He also pushed for reforms to education, access to labor, and a government in which individuals are treated equally, as solutions. This essay is undoubtedly one of Rizal's most analytic and socially conscience works."
