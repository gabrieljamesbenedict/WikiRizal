      "text": "El Filibusterismo is the sequel to Noli Me Tángere, published in 1891 in Ghent, Belgium. The novel presents a darker, more revolutionary tone. The protagonist, Simoun—the disguised and bitter alter ego of Ibarra—returns to the Philippines with the intent to incite rebellion against the corrupt regime. The book critiques both the Spanish authorities and the complicity of the Filipino elite. While Noli sought peaceful reform, El Fili explores the limitations of reform and the lure of revolution. It challenges readers to think about how change should be achieved and whether violence can ever be justified."
