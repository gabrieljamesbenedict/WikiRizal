      "text": "“The Philippines a Century Hence”\n\nThis is a four-part political essay published in the reformist newspaper La Solidaridad. Rizal lays out possible futures for the Philippines in relation to Spanish control in this document. Rizal discusses the various scenarios that could unfold if Spain continues to reject reform; he predicts a revolution, colonization by other foreign nations (especially by the USA), or an eventual independence in the distant future. Rizal also discusses the impact of colonialism on Filipino psyche and society. Rizal argues that Filipinos must be educated, engage in civic life, and be historically aware in order for it to develop and progress. Many of his predictions came true and this speaks to how astute he was about the dynamics of geopolitics and national/colonial development."
