      "text": "“My Last Farewell”\n\nRizal wrote this poem for the first time the night of his execution schedule for December 30, 1896. He hid it in an alcohol stove which was returned to his family after he was executed. The poem was untitled and unsigned, and is now called Mi Último Adiós, (My Last Farewell). It was a powerful farewell capable of expressing everything he felt about the Philippines and his willingness to die for her. His farewell was also a reflection of his love, hope and peace in death. This poem is considered a national Patrimony, a literary work of brilliant imagination, and a patriotic poem of the ultimate sacrifice for the freedom of one's nation. The opening line of Mi Último Adiós became a phrase that called generations of Filipinos to REMEMBER!"
