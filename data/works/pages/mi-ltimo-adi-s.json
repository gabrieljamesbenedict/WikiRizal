      "text": "Rizal wrote this poem for the first time the night of his execution schedule for December 30, 1896. He hid it in an alcohol stove which was returned to his family after he was executed. The poem was untitled and unsigned, and is now called Mi Último Adiós, (My Last Farewell). It was a powerful farewell capable of expressing everything he felt about the Philippines and his willingness to die for her. His farewell was also a reflection of his love, hope and peace in death. This poem is considered a national Patrimony, a literary work of brilliant imagination, and a patriotic poem of the ultimate sacrifice for the freedom of one's nation. The opening line of Mi Último Adiós became a phrase that called generations of Filipinos to REMEMBER!"

      "text": "Mi Último Adiós, written by José Rizal before his execution on December 30, 1896, is a heart-felt farewell poem encapsulating his love for the Philippines and willingness to die for the nation's freedom. The poem was later found by his sister inside an alcohol stove on the cooking stove after Rizal's execution and published under his title by a Filipino priest making sure to honor Rizal. He gave his sister Trining a book and told her there is something in it, even though it would later be revealed as his last poem: \"Mi Ultimo Adios.\" Trining had the poem copied and sent to a contact in Hong Kong for publication and circles as widely as possible. The poem was without a title or Rizal's signature making the story of its discovery even more interesting. Written during his last night in Fort Santiago, the poem is Rizal's supreme gage of love declared for his beloved Philippines."

      "text": "Adieu, my beloved Land, sun-kissed, Pearl of the Orient Sea, our lost Eden,  As much as I rejoice, I am still giving you my Life, and its sad, repressed; and even if it were brighter, fresher, and at the peak of its glory, I would still give it to you for your advantage, above all. The first stanza introduces the poem's vital place of voluntary self-sacrifice for the motherland. These are the words of a man that is about to die for his country - a man that feels no pangs of regret, only gladness, and he knows that in giving his life for his motherland, he is giving his country the finest gift a citizen can give.  Rizal acknowledges death is not an end, but a contribution to the larger promise of his country's eventual liberation. His sacrifice, he argues, is no different than soldiers dying on behalf of a homeland."

      "text": "If one day while standing by my grave, A fragile little flower sprouting in thick grass you see, Lift it to your lips and kiss my soul so, And beneath the cold tomb I might feel on my brow, A warmth of your breath and a little of your tenderness. In this poem, Rizal demonstrates his desire for eternal communion with his country through nature. Rizal considers his soul \"a little flower sprouting in thick grass.\" This self comparison tells much about Rizal's view of himself—timid, little, humble, surrounded by the insurmountable forces of society. He imagines his spirit still continues to serve the Philippines after death, where he becomes part of the atmosphere, wind and soil, demonstrating an eternal connection between patriot and country."

      "text": "Bonifacio secured a number of copies of the poem and was the first to translate it into Tagalog and share it among the members of the Katipunan, a membership that was part of some five million Filipinos by 1898 and who recited it in battle. The importance of the poem extended well beyond Rizal's death; \"Mi Último Adiós\" became more than simply a martyrs poem that was a battle cry for Filipino revolutionaries and the foundation of Philippine literature. Farewell, mother, father, brothers beloved by me, Friends of my childhood, in the troubled home; Give thanks that now that the day has been tiring I rest; Farewell, sweet stranger, my friend who made such bright my way; Farewell to all that I love. Death rests. The last lines of the poem encapsulated both personal farewell and omnipresent message of sacrifice, changing Rizal's martyrdom from an individual murder into obligation to the national liberation. \"Mi Último Adiós\" is now the most significant poem written in the Philippines, a permanent expression of the ideals of patriotism, sacrifice, and love of country that still drives Filipinos today."
