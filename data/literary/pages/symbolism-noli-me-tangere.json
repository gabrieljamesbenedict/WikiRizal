Published in 1887, the novel uses characters, places, and events as symbols to critique Spanish colonial rule and Filipino society. Understanding these symbols reveals the deeper layers of Rizal's social commentary and his vision for Philippine reform."

The title warns against further abuse of the Filipino people."
