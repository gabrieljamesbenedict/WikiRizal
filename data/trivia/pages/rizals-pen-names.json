      "text": "Throughout his prolific career, José Rizal used several pseudonyms to publish his literary and political works, often to avoid persecution by Spanish authorities. Among the most famous were 'Laong Laan' and 'Dimasalang'—names that allowed him to speak out with some degree of anonymity."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "‘Laong Laan’ was used in various articles he contributed to the reformist newspaper La Solidaridad. The name suggests someone always prepared or ever-ready—reflecting Rizal’s readiness to serve the cause of Filipino freedom. Meanwhile, ‘Dimasalang’ roughly translates to 'Untouched' or 'Untarnished,' symbolizing incorruptibility and moral integrity."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "These pen names were not just tools of protection but deliberate rhetorical choices. Rizal crafted them to align with the values he wanted to promote—resilience, purity of purpose, and readiness for national service."

      "text": "The use of pseudonyms was common among revolutionaries and writers during the Spanish colonial era, especially when dealing with politically sensitive topics. With his family and friends under constant scrutiny, Rizal had to conceal his identity to continue publishing without putting them at risk."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "His pseudonyms allowed him to operate within reformist circles while maintaining a degree of plausible deniability. Nevertheless, the quality and tone of his writing often revealed the man behind the name to those paying close attention."
