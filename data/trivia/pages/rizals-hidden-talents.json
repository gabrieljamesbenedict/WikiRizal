      "text": "José Rizal was not only a writer and reformist but also a man of many talents, many of which remain lesser known. He was a painter, sculptor, fencer, polyglot, musician, and even a stage actor. These talents showcased a deeply artistic and disciplined individual who believed in cultivating the whole person."

      "text": "He made sketches and oil paintings, some of which still exist today. His sculptures—often carved from wood, wax, or clay—ranged from busts to figurines and were given as gifts or made for amusement. Even while imprisoned, he created small artworks as mementos."

      "text": "Rizal also played the flute and was said to have a good singing voice. His love for the arts was not separate from his activism—it was part of how he expressed his identity and vision for a cultured, enlightened Filipino society."
