      "text": "During his travels in Europe and Asia, José Rizal crossed paths—directly and indirectly—with several notable figures of his time. Though often remembered in isolation as a Filipino hero, Rizal was very much part of the global intellectual and political scene of the late 19th century."

      "text": "One of the most well-known encounters was with Ferdinand Blumentritt, an Austrian ethnologist and Rizal’s close friend and confidant. Though they never met in person, their letters reveal a deep intellectual partnership that shaped Rizal’s views on anthropology, culture, and nationalism."

      "text": "He also met leaders of the *La Solidaridad* movement in Spain, such as Marcelo H. del Pilar, Graciano López Jaena, and Mariano Ponce. These reformists helped organize the Filipino expatriate community into a force for political change in the Philippines."

      "text": "While studying in Heidelberg, Rizal briefly encountered Dr. Otto Becker, a leading ophthalmologist under whom he trained. In Paris, he attended lectures and medical demonstrations alongside other European intellectuals. He absorbed ideas from thinkers across disciplines—from history and literature to science and philosophy."

      "text": "There is also speculation, though unconfirmed, that Rizal may have crossed paths with figures like Mahatma Gandhi in Europe. While evidence for such meetings is lacking, the parallels between their philosophies on peaceful resistance are striking."

At the same time, his writings and reformist message left a lasting impression on his peers and readers across continents."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Though rooted in Filipino nationalism, Rizal's story is also one of international solidarity. His life demonstrates that real change often arises when local voices engage with global ideas—something he mastered with poise and purpose."
