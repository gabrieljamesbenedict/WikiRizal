      "text": "José Rizal was a master of many disciplines, but one of his most remarkable achievements was his command of multiple languages. He was known to have spoken or studied at least 22 languages, ranging from widely used European tongues to lesser-known Asian dialects. This linguistic ability was not merely academic—Rizal used language as a powerful tool for learning, diplomacy, and political advocacy."

    {

      "text": "The languages Rizal knew included Tagalog, Ilocano, Bisayan, Subanun, Spanish, Latin, Greek, English, French, German, Arabic, Hebrew, Sanskrit, Malay, Dutch, Catalan, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Swedish, and Russian. His deep interest in comparative linguistics allowed him to study local dialects during his exile and identify connections between Philippine languages and their Malay roots."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "His ability to read, write, and converse in these languages enabled him to access scientific texts, correspond with intellectuals abroad, and translate foreign works into Filipino. It also helped him communicate with diverse people during his travels in Europe, Asia, and the Americas—an advantage that no doubt elevated the influence and reach of his reformist efforts."

      "text": "In his writings, Rizal often switched languages depending on his audience. His two novels, *Noli Me Tángere* and *El Filibusterismo*, were written in Spanish to directly address the colonial elite and Spanish authorities. Meanwhile, his essays in La Solidaridad used both Spanish and French to reach reformists across Europe."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Rizal also made it a point to preserve native languages. In his linguistic studies, he emphasized the richness of Philippine dialects and their cultural value. He believed that learning the mother tongue was key to developing national consciousness and pride. This is why he often used Tagalog in personal letters and supported the idea of a Filipino national identity rooted in native culture."

He wasn't just a linguist for academic prestige—he used his skill as a bridge to connect Filipinos with global ideas. His multilingual legacy demonstrates the intellectual depth and cultural adaptability that made him not only a national hero but also a world-class thinker."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "By communicating with the world, Rizal amplified the voice of a colonized people and challenged global perceptions of the Filipino. His linguistic skill remains a testament to the power of education, curiosity, and cultural empathy."
