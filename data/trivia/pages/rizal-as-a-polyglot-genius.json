      "text": "José Rizal wasn’t just a writer, doctor, or reformist—he was also a gifted polyglot who reportedly spoke over 20 languages. From major European tongues like Spanish, French, and German to Asian languages like Japanese, Malay, and Chinese, Rizal displayed an extraordinary ability to absorb and use language."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "His linguistic proficiency was not merely academic. Rizal used language as a tool to connect with people, absorb knowledge, and spread his ideas internationally. While studying in Europe, he frequently wrote letters and essays in multiple languages, depending on the audience and purpose."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "He was even known to correct translators and speak in local dialects to connect with common folk. This mastery of language wasn’t just impressive—it was strategic and often revolutionary in its implications."

      "text": "Rizal’s novels, *Noli Me Tangere* and *El Filibusterismo*, were written in Spanish, the language of the colonizers, but aimed to wake the consciousness of both Spaniards and Filipinos. He knew that language shaped power and access. By mastering it, he reclaimed agency for his people."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "He even attempted to learn Arabic and Hebrew during his later years, showing his deep respect for cultural and religious traditions outside of the West. For Rizal, each language unlocked a new perspective and a new audience for the fight for Philippine reform."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "In a time when most people were confined to one tongue, Rizal’s multilingualism gave him a voice in global conversations. It allowed him to become, not just a hero for the Philippines, but a respected intellectual on the world stage."
